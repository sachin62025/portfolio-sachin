About Me
I'm Sachin Kumar, currently pursuing B.Tech in ECE at IIIT Manipur. I have a passion for machine learning and artificial intelligence.


project section :
	
1. Graph-Based Movie Recommendation System GitHub 
• Designed and implemented an incremental training pipeline to update a Graph RAG-based recommendation
system with new user-movie interactions.
• Optimized FAISS-based vector search for efficient similarity retrieval, reducing redundant computations and
improving model update efficiency.

2. LangChain Content Summarizer GitHub 
• Created an end-to-end application for summarizing content from various sources, including URLs, PDFs, YouTube
videos, and direct text input.
• Leveraged the LangChain framework to enhance language model processing and efficient content extraction.
• Designed a user-friendly interface supporting multiple input formats for seamless and accessible summarization.

4. Next Word Prediction Using LSTM RNN 
• Built an LSTM RNN model for next-word prediction to assist with predictive text.
• Enhanced model performance through hyperparameter optimization and data augmentation techniques.
• Achieved 95.67% accuracy, improving text prediction efficiency and fluency.

6. Deep Learning for Text Generation 
• Developed and trained character-level LSTM (TensorFlow/Keras, loss: 1.4259) and custom GPT (PyTorch, loss:
1.1561) models on the Shakespeare dataset.
• Optimized GPT with accumulation of gradients, mixed precision training and top k / top p sampling for the
generation of fluent and coherent text generation.
